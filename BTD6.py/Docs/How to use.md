The current variables are:
  - gameModel (Game.instance.model)
  - inGame (InGame.instance)
  - util (BTD6.py.Utils.Util)

Util content:
  - BehaviorToAttackModel(Assets.Scripts.Models.Model m)
    > Casts a model into an AttackModel

Creating a mod:
  - If you want your mod to only run once, change the name to include "init"
  - Anything you want to do is only limited by Python, any knowledge of Python will really help
  - Create a new file called "YourModNameHere.py"
  - In the second line type "util"
  - You are now free to do whatever you want to make!
